# Welcome to ShrtQuiz!

ShrtQuiz enables you to create short quizes you can share via a shortened
url. The app has been built with smartphones in mind, and presents the
quiz author with graph statistics for the responses.

## TODO
* finish quiz creation process
* implement quiz (taking a quiz) submission process
* implement model validations (questions should be less than 140 chars)
* build pie charts for quiz stats
* use bitly gem/api for shortening quiz urls
* use twitter gem/api for tweeting a newly created quiz
